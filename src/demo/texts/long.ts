        <p>
          Mr. Sher&shy;lock Holmes, who was usu&shy;al&shy;ly very late in the morn&shy;ings, save upon
          those not in&shy;fre&shy;quent oc&shy;ca&shy;sions when he was up all night, was seat&shy;ed at the
          break&shy;fast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which
          our vis&shy;i&shy;tor had left be&shy;hind him the night be&shy;fore. It was a fine, thick
          piece of wood, bul&shy;bous-head&shy;ed, of the sort which is known as a &ldquo;Penang
          lawyer.&rdquo; Just un&shy;der the head was a broad sil&shy;ver band near&shy;ly an inch
          across. &ldquo;To James Mor&shy;timer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,&rdquo; was
          en&shy;graved upon it, with the date &ldquo;1884.&rdquo; It was just such a stick as the
          old-fash&shy;ioned fam&shy;i&shy;ly prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er used to car&shy;ry&mdash;dig&shy;ni&shy;fied, sol&shy;id,
          and re&shy;as&shy;sur&shy;ing.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Well, Wat&shy;son, what do you make of it?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          Holmes was sit&shy;ting with his back to me, and I had giv&shy;en him no sign of my
          oc&shy;cu&shy;pa&shy;tion.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;How did you know what I was do&shy;ing? I be&shy;lieve you have eyes in the back of
          your head.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I have, at least, a well-pol&shy;ished, sil&shy;ver-plat&shy;ed cof&shy;fee-pot in front of
          me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But, tell me, Wat&shy;son, what do you make of our vis&shy;i&shy;tor&rsquo;s
          stick? Since we have been so un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate as to miss him and have no no&shy;tion
          of his er&shy;rand, this ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal sou&shy;venir be&shy;comes of im&shy;por&shy;tance. Let me hear
          you re&shy;con&shy;struct the man by an ex&shy;am&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion of it.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, fol&shy;low&shy;ing as far as I could the meth&shy;ods of my
          com&shy;pan&shy;ion, &ldquo;that Dr. Mor&shy;timer is a suc&shy;cess&shy;ful, el&shy;der&shy;ly med&shy;ical man,
          well-es&shy;teemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
          ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Ex&shy;cel&shy;lent!&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I think also that the prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty is in favour of his be&shy;ing a coun&shy;try
          prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er who does a great deal of his vis&shy;it&shy;ing on foot.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Be&shy;cause this stick, though orig&shy;i&shy;nal&shy;ly a very hand&shy;some one has been so
          knocked about that I can hard&shy;ly imag&shy;ine a town prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er car&shy;ry&shy;ing it.
          The thick-iron fer&shy;rule is worn down, so it is ev&shy;i&shy;dent that he has done a
          great amount of walk&shy;ing with it.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Per&shy;fect&shy;ly sound!&rdquo; said Holmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;And then again, there is the &lsquo;friends of the C.C.H.&rsquo; I should guess that
          to be the Some&shy;thing Hunt, the lo&shy;cal hunt to whose mem&shy;bers he has pos&shy;si&shy;bly
          giv&shy;en some sur&shy;gi&shy;cal as&shy;sis&shy;tance, and which has made him a small
          pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion in re&shy;turn.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Re&shy;al&shy;ly, Wat&shy;son, you ex&shy;cel your&shy;self,&rdquo; said Holmes, push&shy;ing back his chair
          and light&shy;ing a cig&shy;a&shy;rette. &ldquo;I am bound to say that in all the ac&shy;counts
          which you have been so good as to give of my own small achieve&shy;ments you
          have ha&shy;bit&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly un&shy;der&shy;rat&shy;ed your own abil&shy;i&shy;ties. It may be that you are not
          your&shy;self lu&shy;mi&shy;nous, but you are a con&shy;duc&shy;tor of light. Some peo&shy;ple with&shy;out
          pos&shy;sess&shy;ing ge&shy;nius have a re&shy;mark&shy;able pow&shy;er of stim&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing it. I con&shy;fess, my
          dear fel&shy;low, that I am very much in your debt.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          He had nev&shy;er said as much be&shy;fore, and I must ad&shy;mit that his words gave me
          keen plea&shy;sure, for I had of&shy;ten been piqued by his in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ence to my
          ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;tion and to the at&shy;tempts which I had made to give pub&shy;lic&shy;i&shy;ty to his
          meth&shy;ods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mas&shy;tered his sys&shy;tem
          as to ap&shy;ply it in a way which earned his ap&shy;proval. He now took the stick
          from my hands and ex&shy;am&shy;ined it for a few min&shy;utes with his naked eyes. Then
          with an ex&shy;pres&shy;sion of in&shy;ter&shy;est he laid down his cig&shy;a&shy;rette, and car&shy;ry&shy;ing
          the cane to the win&shy;dow, he looked over it again with a con&shy;vex lens.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;In&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing, though el&shy;e&shy;men&shy;tary,&rdquo; said he as he re&shy;turned to his favourite
          cor&shy;ner of the set&shy;tee. &ldquo;There are cer&shy;tain&shy;ly one or two in&shy;di&shy;ca&shy;tions upon the
          stick. It gives us the ba&shy;sis for sev&shy;er&shy;al de&shy;duc&shy;tions.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Has any&shy;thing es&shy;caped me?&rdquo; I asked with some self-im&shy;por&shy;tance. &ldquo;I trust
          that there is noth&shy;ing of con&shy;se&shy;quence which I have over&shy;looked?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I am afraid, my dear Wat&shy;son, that most of your con&shy;clu&shy;sions were
          er&shy;ro&shy;neous. When I said that you stim&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed me I meant, to be frank, that
          in not&shy;ing your fal&shy;lac&shy;i&shy;es I was oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly guid&shy;ed to&shy;wards the truth. Not
          that you are en&shy;tire&shy;ly wrong in this in&shy;stance. The man is cer&shy;tain&shy;ly a
          coun&shy;try prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er. And he walks a good deal.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Then I was right.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;To that ex&shy;tent.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;But that was all.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;No, no, my dear Wat&shy;son, not all&mdash;by no means all. I would sug&shy;gest,
          for ex&shy;am&shy;ple, that a pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion to a doc&shy;tor is more like&shy;ly to come from a
          hos&shy;pi&shy;tal than from a hunt, and that when the ini&shy;tials &lsquo;C.C.&rsquo; are placed
          be&shy;fore that hos&shy;pi&shy;tal the words &lsquo;Char&shy;ing Cross&rsquo; very nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ly sug&shy;gest
          them&shy;selves.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;You may be right.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty lies in that di&shy;rec&shy;tion. And if we take this as a work&shy;ing
          hy&shy;poth&shy;e&shy;sis we have a fresh ba&shy;sis from which to start our con&shy;struc&shy;tion of
          this un&shy;known vis&shy;i&shy;tor.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Well, then, sup&shy;pos&shy;ing that &lsquo;C.C.H.&rsquo; does stand for &lsquo;Char&shy;ing Cross
          Hos&shy;pi&shy;tal,&rsquo; what fur&shy;ther in&shy;fer&shy;ences may we draw?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Do none sug&shy;gest them&shy;selves? You know my meth&shy;ods. Ap&shy;ply them!&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I can only think of the ob&shy;vi&shy;ous con&shy;clu&shy;sion that the man has prac&shy;tised in
          town be&shy;fore go&shy;ing to the coun&shy;try.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I think that we might ven&shy;ture a lit&shy;tle far&shy;ther than this. Look at it in
          this light. On what oc&shy;ca&shy;sion would it be most prob&shy;a&shy;ble that such a
          pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a
          pledge of their good will? Ob&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly at the mo&shy;ment when Dr. Mor&shy;timer
          with&shy;drew from the ser&shy;vice of the hos&shy;pi&shy;tal in or&shy;der to start a prac&shy;tice for
          him&shy;self. We know there has been a pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion. We be&shy;lieve there has been
          a change from a town hos&shy;pi&shy;tal to a coun&shy;try prac&shy;tice. Is it, then,
          stretch&shy;ing our in&shy;fer&shy;ence too far to say that the pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion was on the
          oc&shy;ca&shy;sion of the change?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;It cer&shy;tain&shy;ly seems prob&shy;a&shy;ble.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Now, you will ob&shy;serve that he could not have been on the <i>staff</i> of the
          hos&shy;pi&shy;tal, since only a man well-es&shy;tab&shy;lished in a Lon&shy;don prac&shy;tice could
          hold such a po&shy;si&shy;tion, and such a one would not drift into the coun&shy;try.
          What was he, then? If he was in the hos&shy;pi&shy;tal and yet not on the staff he
          could only have been a house-sur&shy;geon or a house-physi&shy;cian&mdash;lit&shy;tle
          more than a se&shy;nior stu&shy;dent. And he left five years ago&mdash;the date is
          on the stick. So your grave, mid&shy;dle-aged fam&shy;i&shy;ly prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er van&shy;ish&shy;es into
          thin air, my dear Wat&shy;son, and there emerges a young fel&shy;low un&shy;der thir&shy;ty,
          ami&shy;able, un&shy;am&shy;bi&shy;tious, ab&shy;sent-mind&shy;ed, and the pos&shy;ses&shy;sor of a favourite dog,
          which I should de&shy;scribe rough&shy;ly as be&shy;ing larg&shy;er than a ter&shy;ri&shy;er and small&shy;er
          than a mas&shy;tiff.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          I laughed in&shy;cred&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly as Sher&shy;lock Holmes leaned back in his set&shy;tee and
          blew lit&shy;tle wa&shy;ver&shy;ing rings of smoke up to the ceil&shy;ing.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;As to the lat&shy;ter part, I have no means of check&shy;ing you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but at
          least it is not dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to find out a few par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lars about the man&rsquo;s
          age and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al ca&shy;reer.&rdquo; From my small med&shy;ical shelf I took down the
          Med&shy;ical Di&shy;rec&shy;to&shy;ry and turned up the name. There were sev&shy;er&shy;al Mor&shy;timers,
          but only one who could be our vis&shy;i&shy;tor. I read his record aloud.
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            &ldquo;Mor&shy;timer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dart&shy;moor, De&shy;von.
            House-sur&shy;geon, from 1882 to 1884, at Char&shy;ing Cross Hos&shy;pi&shy;tal. Win&shy;ner of
            the Jack&shy;son prize for Com&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tive Pathol&shy;o&shy;gy, with es&shy;say en&shy;ti&shy;tled
            &lsquo;Is Dis&shy;ease a Re&shy;ver&shy;sion?&rsquo;  Cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ing mem&shy;ber of the
            Swedish Patho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal So&shy;ci&shy;ety.  Au&shy;thor of &lsquo;Some Freaks of

            parish&shy;es of Grimpen, Thors&shy;ley, and High Bar&shy;row.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;No men&shy;tion of that lo&shy;cal hunt, Wat&shy;son,&rdquo; said Holmes with a mis&shy;chie&shy;vous
          smile, &ldquo;but a coun&shy;try doc&shy;tor, as you very as&shy;tute&shy;ly ob&shy;served. I think that
          I am fair&shy;ly jus&shy;ti&shy;fied in my in&shy;fer&shy;ences. As to the ad&shy;jec&shy;tives, I said, if I
          re&shy;mem&shy;ber right, ami&shy;able, un&shy;am&shy;bi&shy;tious, and ab&shy;sent-mind&shy;ed. It is my
          ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence that it is only an ami&shy;able man in this world who re&shy;ceives
          tes&shy;ti&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;als, only an un&shy;am&shy;bi&shy;tious one who aban&shy;dons a Lon&shy;don ca&shy;reer for the
          coun&shy;try, and only an ab&shy;sent-mind&shy;ed one who leaves his stick and not his
          vis&shy;it&shy;ing-card af&shy;ter wait&shy;ing an hour in your room.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;And the dog?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Has been in the habit of car&shy;ry&shy;ing this stick be&shy;hind his mas&shy;ter. Be&shy;ing a
          heavy stick the dog has held it tight&shy;ly by the mid&shy;dle, and the marks of
          his teeth are very plain&shy;ly vis&shy;i&shy;ble. The dog&rsquo;s jaw, as shown in the space
          be&shy;tween these marks, is too broad in my opin&shy;ion for a ter&shy;ri&shy;er and not
          broad enough for a mas&shy;tiff. It may have been&mdash;yes, by Jove, it <i>is</i> a
          curly-haired spaniel.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halt&shy;ed in the re&shy;cess
          of the win&shy;dow. There was such a ring of con&shy;vic&shy;tion in his voice that I
          glanced up in sur&shy;prise.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;My dear fel&shy;low, how can you pos&shy;si&shy;bly be so sure of that?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;For the very sim&shy;ple rea&shy;son that I see the dog him&shy;self on our very
          door-step, and there is the ring of its own&shy;er. Don&rsquo;t move, I beg you,
          Wat&shy;son. He is a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al broth&shy;er of yours, and your pres&shy;ence may be of
          as&shy;sis&shy;tance to me. Now is the dra&shy;mat&shy;ic mo&shy;ment of fate, Wat&shy;son, when you
          hear a step upon the stair which is walk&shy;ing into your life, and you know
          not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mor&shy;timer, the man of
          sci&shy;ence, ask of Sher&shy;lock Holmes, the spe&shy;cial&shy;ist in crime? Come in!&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          The ap&shy;pear&shy;ance of our vis&shy;i&shy;tor was a sur&shy;prise to me, since I had ex&shy;pect&shy;ed a
          typ&shy;i&shy;cal coun&shy;try prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long
          nose like a beak, which jut&shy;ted out be&shy;tween two keen, grey eyes, set
          close&shy;ly to&shy;geth&shy;er and sparkling bright&shy;ly from be&shy;hind a pair of gold-rimmed
          glass&shy;es. He was clad in a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al but rather sloven&shy;ly fash&shy;ion, for
          his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long
          back was al&shy;ready bowed, and he walked with a for&shy;ward thrust of his head
          and a gen&shy;er&shy;al air of peer&shy;ing benev&shy;o&shy;lence. As he en&shy;tered his eyes fell upon
          the stick in Holmes&rsquo;s hand, and he ran to&shy;wards it with an ex&shy;cla&shy;ma&shy;tion of
          joy. &ldquo;I am so very glad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was not sure whether I had left it
          here or in the Ship&shy;ping Of&shy;fice. I would not lose that stick for the
          world.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;A pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion, I see,&rdquo; said Holmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;From Char&shy;ing Cross Hos&shy;pi&shy;tal?&rdquo;

        <p>
          &ldquo;From one or two friends there on the oc&shy;ca&shy;sion of my mar&shy;riage.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Dear, dear, that&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; said Holmes, shak&shy;ing his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Mor&shy;timer blinked through his glass&shy;es in mild as&shy;ton&shy;ish&shy;ment. &ldquo;Why was it
          bad?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Only that you have dis&shy;arranged our lit&shy;tle de&shy;duc&shy;tions. Your mar&shy;riage, you
          say?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Yes, sir. I mar&shy;ried, and so left the hos&shy;pi&shy;tal, and with it all hopes of a
          con&shy;sult&shy;ing prac&shy;tice. It was nec&shy;es&shy;sary to make a home of my own.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Come, come, we are not so far wrong, af&shy;ter all,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;And now,
          Dr. James Mor&shy;timer&mdash;&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Mis&shy;ter, sir, Mis&shy;ter&mdash;a hum&shy;ble M.R.C.S.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;And a man of pre&shy;cise mind, ev&shy;i&shy;dent&shy;ly.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;A dab&shy;bler in sci&shy;ence, Mr. Holmes, a pick&shy;er up of shells on the shores of
          the great un&shy;known ocean. I pre&shy;sume that it is Mr. Sher&shy;lock Holmes whom I
          am ad&shy;dress&shy;ing and not&mdash;&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;No, this is my friend Dr. Wat&shy;son.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name men&shy;tioned in con&shy;nec&shy;tion
          with that of your friend. You in&shy;ter&shy;est me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had
          hard&shy;ly ex&shy;pect&shy;ed so dolicho&shy;cephal&shy;ic a skull or such well-marked
          supra-or&shy;bital de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment. Would you have any ob&shy;jec&shy;tion to my run&shy;ning my
          fin&shy;ger along your pari&shy;etal fis&shy;sure? A cast of your skull, sir, un&shy;til the
          orig&shy;i&shy;nal is avail&shy;able, would be an or&shy;na&shy;ment to any an&shy;thro&shy;po&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal mu&shy;se&shy;um.
          It is not my in&shy;ten&shy;tion to be ful&shy;some, but I con&shy;fess that I cov&shy;et your
          skull.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          Sher&shy;lock Holmes waved our strange vis&shy;i&shy;tor into a chair. &ldquo;You are an
          en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;ast in your line of thought, I per&shy;ceive, sir, as I am in mine,&rdquo;
           said he. &ldquo;I ob&shy;serve from your fore&shy;fin&shy;ger that you make your own
          cig&shy;a&shy;rettes. Have no hes&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion in light&shy;ing one.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          The man drew out pa&shy;per and to&shy;bac&shy;co and twirled the one up in the oth&shy;er
          with sur&shy;pris&shy;ing dex&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;ty. He had long, quiv&shy;er&shy;ing fin&shy;gers as ag&shy;ile and
          rest&shy;less as the an&shy;ten&shy;næ of an in&shy;sect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holmes was silent, but his lit&shy;tle dart&shy;ing glances showed me the in&shy;ter&shy;est
          which he took in our cu&shy;ri&shy;ous com&shy;pan&shy;ion. &ldquo;I pre&shy;sume, sir,&rdquo; said he at last,
          &ldquo;that it was not mere&shy;ly for the pur&shy;pose of ex&shy;am&shy;in&shy;ing my skull that you
          have done me the ho&shy;n&shy;our to call here last night and again to&shy;day?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;No, sir, no; though I am hap&shy;py to have had the op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty of do&shy;ing that
          as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, be&shy;cause I rec&shy;og&shy;nized that I am my&shy;self
          an un&shy;prac&shy;ti&shy;cal man and be&shy;cause I am sud&shy;den&shy;ly con&shy;front&shy;ed with a most
          se&shy;ri&shy;ous and ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary prob&shy;lem. Rec&shy;og&shy;niz&shy;ing, as I do, that you are the
          sec&shy;ond high&shy;est ex&shy;pert in Eu&shy;rope&mdash;&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;In&shy;deed, sir! May I in&shy;quire who has the ho&shy;n&shy;our to be the first?&rdquo; asked
          Holmes with some as&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ty.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;To the man of pre&shy;cise&shy;ly sci&shy;en&shy;tif&shy;ic mind the work of Mon&shy;sieur Bertillon
          must al&shy;ways ap&shy;peal strong&shy;ly.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Then had you not bet&shy;ter con&shy;sult him?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I said, sir, to the pre&shy;cise&shy;ly sci&shy;en&shy;tif&shy;ic mind. But as a prac&shy;ti&shy;cal man of
          af&shy;fairs it is ac&shy;knowl&shy;edged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have
          not in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly&mdash;&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Just a lit&shy;tle,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I think, Dr. Mor&shy;timer, you would do wise&shy;ly
          if with&shy;out more ado you would kind&shy;ly tell me plain&shy;ly what the ex&shy;act na&shy;ture
          of the prob&shy;lem is in which you de&shy;mand my as&shy;sis&shy;tance.&rdquo;

    The Curse of the Baskervilles</h2>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I have in my pock&shy;et a man&shy;u&shy;script,&rdquo; said Dr. James Mor&shy;timer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I ob&shy;served it as you en&shy;tered the room,&rdquo; said Holmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;It is an old man&shy;u&shy;script.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Ear&shy;ly eigh&shy;teenth cen&shy;tu&shy;ry, un&shy;less it is a forgery.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;How can you say that, sir?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;You have pre&shy;sent&shy;ed an inch or two of it to my ex&shy;am&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion all the time
          that you have been talk&shy;ing. It would be a poor ex&shy;pert who could not give
          the date of a doc&shy;u&shy;ment with&shy;in a decade or so. You may pos&shy;si&shy;bly have read
          my lit&shy;tle mono&shy;graph upon the sub&shy;ject. I put that at 1730.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The ex&shy;act date is 1742.&rdquo; Dr. Mor&shy;timer drew it from his breast-pock&shy;et.
          &ldquo;This fam&shy;i&shy;ly pa&shy;per was com&shy;mit&shy;ted to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
          whose sud&shy;den and trag&shy;ic death some three months ago cre&shy;at&shy;ed so much
          ex&shy;cite&shy;ment in De&shy;von&shy;shire. I may say that I was his per&shy;son&shy;al friend as well
          as his med&shy;ical at&shy;ten&shy;dant. He was a strong-mind&shy;ed man, sir, shrewd,
          prac&shy;ti&shy;cal, and as unimag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tive as I am my&shy;self. Yet he took this doc&shy;u&shy;ment
          very se&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly, and his mind was pre&shy;pared for just such an end as did
          even&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly over&shy;take him.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          Holmes stretched out his hand for the man&shy;u&shy;script and flat&shy;tened it upon
          his knee. &ldquo;You will ob&shy;serve, Wat&shy;son, the al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive use of the
          long <i>s</i> and the short. It is one of sev&shy;er&shy;al in&shy;di&shy;ca&shy;tions which
          en&shy;abled me to fix the date.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          I looked over his shoul&shy;der at the yel&shy;low pa&shy;per and the fad&shy;ed script. At
          the head was writ&shy;ten: &ldquo;Baskerville Hall,&rdquo; and be&shy;low in large, scrawl&shy;ing
          fig&shy;ures: &ldquo;1742.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;It ap&shy;pears to be a state&shy;ment of some sort.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Yes, it is a state&shy;ment of a cer&shy;tain leg&shy;end which runs in the Baskerville
          fam&shy;i&shy;ly.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;But I un&shy;der&shy;stand that it is some&shy;thing more mod&shy;ern and prac&shy;ti&shy;cal upon
          which you wish to con&shy;sult me?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Most mod&shy;ern. A most prac&shy;ti&shy;cal, press&shy;ing mat&shy;ter, which must be de&shy;cid&shy;ed
          with&shy;in twen&shy;ty-four hours. But the man&shy;u&shy;script is short and is in&shy;ti&shy;mate&shy;ly
          con&shy;nect&shy;ed with the af&shy;fair. With your per&shy;mis&shy;sion I will read it to you.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his fin&shy;ger-tips to&shy;geth&shy;er, and
          closed his eyes, with an air of res&shy;ig&shy;na&shy;tion. Dr. Mor&shy;timer turned the
          man&shy;u&shy;script to the light and read in a high, crack&shy;ing voice the fol&shy;low&shy;ing
          cu&shy;ri&shy;ous, old-world nar&shy;ra&shy;tive:
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            &ldquo;Of the ori&shy;gin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
            many state&shy;ments, yet as I come in a di&shy;rect line from Hugo Baskerville,
            and as I had the sto&shy;ry from my fa&shy;ther, who also had it from his, I have
            set it down with all be&shy;lief that it oc&shy;curred even as is here set forth.
             And I would have you be&shy;lieve, my sons, that the same Jus&shy;tice which
            pun&shy;ish&shy;es sin may also most gra&shy;cious&shy;ly for&shy;give it, and that no ban is so
            heavy but that by prayer and re&shy;pen&shy;tance it may be re&shy;moved.  Learn then
            from this sto&shy;ry not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be
            cir&shy;cum&shy;spect in the fu&shy;ture, that those foul pas&shy;sions where&shy;by our fam&shy;i&shy;ly
            has suf&shy;fered so griev&shy;ous&shy;ly may not again be loosed to our un&shy;do&shy;ing.<br />
                &ldquo;Know then that in the time of the Great Re&shy;bel&shy;lion (the
            his&shy;to&shy;ry of which by the learned Lord Claren&shy;don I most earnest&shy;ly com&shy;mend
            to your at&shy;ten&shy;tion) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that
            name, nor can it be gain&shy;said that he was a most wild, pro&shy;fane, and
            god&shy;less man.  This, in truth, his neigh&shy;bours might have par&shy;doned,
            see&shy;ing that saints have nev&shy;er flour&shy;ished in those parts, but there was
            in him a cer&shy;tain wan&shy;ton and cru&shy;el hu&shy;mour which made his name a by-word
            through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, in&shy;deed,
            so dark a pas&shy;sion may be known un&shy;der so bright a name) the daugh&shy;ter of
            a yeo&shy;man who held lands near the Baskerville es&shy;tate. But the young
            maid&shy;en, be&shy;ing dis&shy;creet and of good re&shy;pute, would ever avoid him, for
            she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one Michael&shy;mas this
            Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked com&shy;pan&shy;ions, stole down
            upon the farm and car&shy;ried off the maid&shy;en, her fa&shy;ther and broth&shy;ers be&shy;ing
            from home, as he well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the
            maid&shy;en was placed in an up&shy;per cham&shy;ber, while Hugo and his friends sat
            down to a long carouse, as was their night&shy;ly cus&shy;tom.  Now, the poor
            lass up&shy;stairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and
            shout&shy;ing and ter&shy;ri&shy;ble oaths which came up to her from be&shy;low, for they
            say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were
            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the stress of
            her fear she did that which might have daunt&shy;ed the bravest or most
            ac&shy;tive man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which cov&shy;ered (and
            still cov&shy;ers) the south wall she came down from un&shy;der the eaves, and so
            home&shy;ward across the moor, there be&shy;ing three leagues be&shy;twixt the Hall
            and her fa&shy;ther&rsquo;s farm.<br />
                &ldquo;It chanced that some lit&shy;tle time lat&shy;er Hugo left his guests
            to car&shy;ry food and drink&mdash;with oth&shy;er worse things,
            per&shy;chance&mdash;to his cap&shy;tive, and so found the cage emp&shy;ty and the
            bird es&shy;caped.  Then, as it would seem, he be&shy;came as one that hath a
            dev&shy;il, for, rush&shy;ing down the stairs into the din&shy;ing-hall, he sprang
            upon the great table, flagons and trenchers fly&shy;ing be&shy;fore him, and he
            cried aloud be&shy;fore all the com&shy;pa&shy;ny that he would that very night ren&shy;der
            his body and soul to the Pow&shy;ers of Evil if he might but over&shy;take the
            wench.  And while the rev&shy;ellers stood aghast at the fury of the man,
            one more wicked or, it may be, more drunk&shy;en than the rest, cried out
            that they should put the hounds upon her.  Where&shy;at Hugo ran from the
            house, cry&shy;ing to his grooms that they should sad&shy;dle his mare and
            un&shy;ken&shy;nel the pack, and giv&shy;ing the hounds a ker&shy;chief of the
            maid&rsquo;s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the
            moon&shy;light over the moor.<br />
                &ldquo;Now, for some space the rev&shy;ellers stood agape, un&shy;able to
            un&shy;der&shy;stand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon their
            be&shy;mused wits awoke to the na&shy;ture of the deed which was like to be done
            upon the moor&shy;lands.  Every&shy;thing was now in an up&shy;roar, some call&shy;ing for
            their pis&shy;tols, some for their hors&shy;es, and some for an&shy;oth&shy;er flask of
            wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and
            the whole of them, thir&shy;teen in num&shy;ber, took horse and start&shy;ed in
            pur&shy;suit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swift&shy;ly
            abreast, tak&shy;ing that course which the maid must needs have tak&shy;en if she
            were to reach her own home.<br />
                &ldquo;They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
            night shep&shy;herds upon the moor&shy;lands, and they cried to him to know if he
            had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the sto&shy;ry goes, was so crazed with
            fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had in&shy;deed
            seen the un&shy;hap&shy;py maid&shy;en, with the hounds upon her track.  &lsquo;But I
            have seen more than that,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for Hugo Baskerville
            passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute be&shy;hind him such a
            hound of hell as God for&shy;bid should ever be at my heels.&rsquo;  So the
            drunk&shy;en squires cursed the shep&shy;herd and rode on&shy;ward.  But soon their
            skins turned cold, for there came a gal&shy;lop&shy;ing across the moor, and the
            black mare, dab&shy;bled with white froth, went past with trail&shy;ing bri&shy;dle
            and emp&shy;ty sad&shy;dle.  Then the rev&shy;ellers rode close to&shy;geth&shy;er, for a great
            fear was on them, but they still fol&shy;lowed over the moor, though each,
            had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his
            horse&rsquo;s head.  Rid&shy;ing slow&shy;ly in this fash&shy;ion they came at last
            upon the hounds.  These, though known for their val&shy;our and their breed,
            were whim&shy;per&shy;ing in a clus&shy;ter at the head of a deep dip or goy&shy;al, as we
            call it, upon the moor, some slink&shy;ing away and some, with start&shy;ing
            hack&shy;les and star&shy;ing eyes, gaz&shy;ing down the nar&shy;row val&shy;ley be&shy;fore
            them.<br />
                &ldquo;The com&shy;pa&shy;ny had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
            guess, than when they start&shy;ed.  The most of them would by no means
            ad&shy;vance, but three of them, the bold&shy;est, or it may be the most drunk&shy;en,
            rode for&shy;ward down the goy&shy;al. Now, it opened into a broad space in which
            stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set
            by cer&shy;tain for&shy;got&shy;ten peo&shy;ples in the days of old. The moon was shin&shy;ing
            bright upon the clear&shy;ing, and there in the cen&shy;tre lay the un&shy;hap&shy;py maid
            where she had fall&shy;en, dead of fear and of fa&shy;tigue.  But it was not the
            sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville
            ly&shy;ing near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
            dare-dev&shy;il roys&shy;ter&shy;ers, but it was that, stand&shy;ing over Hugo, and
            pluck&shy;ing at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,
            shaped like a hound, yet larg&shy;er than any hound that ever mor&shy;tal eye has
            rest&shy;ed upon.  And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of
            Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blaz&shy;ing eyes and drip&shy;ping
            jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life,
            still scream&shy;ing, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that very
            night of what he had seen, and the oth&shy;er twain were but bro&shy;ken men for
            the rest of their days.<br />
                &ldquo;Such is the tale, my sons, of the com&shy;ing of the hound which
            is said to have plagued the fam&shy;i&shy;ly so sore&shy;ly ever since.  If I have set
            it down it is be&shy;cause that which is clear&shy;ly known hath less ter&shy;ror than
            that which is but hint&shy;ed at and guessed.  Nor can it be de&shy;nied that
            many of the fam&shy;i&shy;ly have been un&shy;hap&shy;py in their deaths, which have been
            sud&shy;den, bloody, and mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous.  Yet may we shel&shy;ter our&shy;selves in the
            in&shy;fi&shy;nite good&shy;ness of Prov&shy;i&shy;dence, which would not for&shy;ev&shy;er pun&shy;ish the
            in&shy;no&shy;cent be&shy;yond that third or fourth gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion which is threat&shy;ened in
            Holy Writ.  To that Prov&shy;i&shy;dence, my sons, I here&shy;by com&shy;mend you, and I
            coun&shy;sel you by way of cau&shy;tion to for&shy;bear from cross&shy;ing the moor in
            those dark hours when the pow&shy;ers of evil are ex&shy;alt&shy;ed.<br />
                &ldquo;[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,
            with in&shy;struc&shy;tions that they say noth&shy;ing there&shy;of to their sis&shy;ter
            Eliz&shy;a&shy;beth.]&rdquo;

        <p>
          When Dr. Mor&shy;timer had fin&shy;ished read&shy;ing this sin&shy;gu&shy;lar nar&shy;ra&shy;tive he pushed
          his spec&shy;ta&shy;cles up on his fore&shy;head and stared across at Mr. Sher&shy;lock
          Holmes. The lat&shy;ter yawned and tossed the end of his cig&shy;a&shy;rette into the
          fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Do you not find it in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing?&rdquo;
         </p>

          Dr. Mor&shy;timer drew a fold&shy;ed news&shy;pa&shy;per out of his pock&shy;et.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you some&shy;thing a lit&shy;tle more re&shy;cent. This is
          the <i>De&shy;von Coun&shy;ty Chron&shy;i&shy;cle</i> of May 14th of this year. It is a short ac&shy;count
          of the facts elicit&shy;ed at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which
          oc&shy;curred a few days be&shy;fore that date.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          My friend leaned a lit&shy;tle for&shy;ward and his ex&shy;pres&shy;sion be&shy;came in&shy;tent. Our
          vis&shy;i&shy;tor read&shy;just&shy;ed his glass&shy;es and be&shy;gan:
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            &ldquo;The re&shy;cent sud&shy;den death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
            has been men&shy;tioned as the prob&shy;a&shy;ble Lib&shy;er&shy;al can&shy;di&shy;date for Mid-De&shy;von at
            the next elec&shy;tion, has cast a gloom over the coun&shy;ty.  Though Sir
            Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a com&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tive&shy;ly short
            pe&shy;ri&shy;od his ami&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of char&shy;ac&shy;ter and ex&shy;treme gen&shy;eros&shy;i&shy;ty had won the
            af&shy;fec&shy;tion and re&shy;spect of all who had been brought into con&shy;tact with
            him.  In these days of <i>nou&shy;veaux rich&shy;es</i> it is re&shy;fresh&shy;ing to find a case
            where the scion of an old coun&shy;ty fam&shy;i&shy;ly which has fall&shy;en upon evil days
            is able to make his own for&shy;tune and to bring it back with him to
            re&shy;store the fall&shy;en grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well
            known, made large sums of mon&shy;ey in South African spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion. More wise
            than those who go on un&shy;til the wheel turns against them, he re&shy;alised
            his gains and re&shy;turned to Eng&shy;land with them.  It is only two years
            since he took up his res&shy;i&shy;dence at Baskerville Hall, and it is com&shy;mon
            talk how large were those schemes of re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion and im&shy;prove&shy;ment
            which have been in&shy;ter&shy;rupt&shy;ed by his death.  Be&shy;ing him&shy;self child&shy;less, it
            was his open&shy;ly ex&shy;pressed de&shy;sire that the whole coun&shy;try&shy;side should,
            with&shy;in his own life&shy;time, prof&shy;it by his good for&shy;tune, and many will have
            per&shy;son&shy;al rea&shy;sons for be&shy;wail&shy;ing his un&shy;time&shy;ly end.  His gen&shy;er&shy;ous
            do&shy;na&shy;tions to lo&shy;cal and coun&shy;ty char&shy;i&shy;ties have been fre&shy;quent&shy;ly chron&shy;i&shy;cled
            in these columns.<br />
                &ldquo;The cir&shy;cum&shy;stances con&shy;nect&shy;ed with the death of Sir Charles
            can&shy;not be said to have been en&shy;tire&shy;ly cleared up by the in&shy;quest, but at
            least enough has been done to dis&shy;pose of those ru&shy;mours to which lo&shy;cal
            su&shy;per&shy;sti&shy;tion has giv&shy;en rise. There is no rea&shy;son what&shy;ev&shy;er to sus&shy;pect
            foul play, or to imag&shy;ine that death could be from any but nat&shy;ur&shy;al
            caus&shy;es. Sir Charles was a wid&shy;ow&shy;er, and a man who may be said to have
            been in some ways of an ec&shy;cen&shy;tric habit of mind. In spite of his
            con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;able wealth he was sim&shy;ple in his per&shy;son&shy;al tastes, and his
            in&shy;door ser&shy;vants at Baskerville Hall con&shy;sist&shy;ed of a mar&shy;ried cou&shy;ple named
            Bar&shy;ry&shy;more, the hus&shy;band act&shy;ing as but&shy;ler and the wife as house&shy;keep&shy;er.
            Their ev&shy;i&shy;dence, cor&shy;rob&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed by that of sev&shy;er&shy;al friends, tends to show
            that Sir Charles&rsquo;s health has for some time been im&shy;paired, and
            points es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly to some af&shy;fec&shy;tion of the heart, man&shy;i&shy;fest&shy;ing it&shy;self in
            changes of colour, breath&shy;less&shy;ness, and acute at&shy;tacks of ner&shy;vous
            de&shy;pres&shy;sion. Dr. James Mor&shy;timer, the friend and med&shy;ical at&shy;ten&shy;dant of the
            de&shy;ceased, has giv&shy;en ev&shy;i&shy;dence to the same ef&shy;fect.<br />
                &ldquo;The facts of the case are sim&shy;ple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
            was in the habit every night be&shy;fore go&shy;ing to bed of walk&shy;ing down the
            fa&shy;mous yew al&shy;ley of Baskerville Hall.  The ev&shy;i&shy;dence of the Bar&shy;ry&shy;mores
            shows that this had been his cus&shy;tom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles
            had de&shy;clared his in&shy;ten&shy;tion of start&shy;ing next day for Lon&shy;don, and had
            or&shy;dered Bar&shy;ry&shy;more to pre&shy;pare his lug&shy;gage.  That night he went out as
            usu&shy;al for his noc&shy;tur&shy;nal walk, in the course of which he was in the
            habit of smok&shy;ing a cig&shy;ar.  He nev&shy;er re&shy;turned.  At twelve o&rsquo;clock
            Bar&shy;ry&shy;more, find&shy;ing the hall door still open, be&shy;came alarmed, and,
            light&shy;ing a lantern, went in search of his mas&shy;ter.  The day had been
            wet, and Sir Charles&rsquo;s foot&shy;marks were eas&shy;i&shy;ly traced down the
            al&shy;ley.  Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to
            the moor. There were in&shy;di&shy;ca&shy;tions that Sir Charles had stood for some
            lit&shy;tle time here.  He then pro&shy;ceed&shy;ed down the al&shy;ley, and it was at the
            far end of it that his body was dis&shy;cov&shy;ered. One fact which has not been
            ex&shy;plained is the state&shy;ment of Bar&shy;ry&shy;more that his mas&shy;ter&rsquo;s
            foot&shy;prints al&shy;tered their char&shy;ac&shy;ter from the time that he passed the
            moor-gate, and that he ap&shy;peared from thence on&shy;ward to have been walk&shy;ing
            upon his toes.  One Mur&shy;phy, a gip&shy;sy horse-deal&shy;er, was on the moor at no
            great dis&shy;tance at the time, but he ap&shy;pears by his own con&shy;fes&shy;sion to
            have been the worse for drink. He de&shy;clares that he heard cries but is
            un&shy;able to state from what di&shy;rec&shy;tion they came.  No signs of vi&shy;o&shy;lence
            were to be dis&shy;cov&shy;ered upon Sir Charles&rsquo;s per&shy;son, and though the
            doc&shy;tor&rsquo;s ev&shy;i&shy;dence point&shy;ed to an al&shy;most in&shy;cred&shy;i&shy;ble fa&shy;cial
            dis&shy;tor&shy;tion&mdash;so great that Dr. Mor&shy;timer re&shy;fused at first to be&shy;lieve
            that it was in&shy;deed his friend and pa&shy;tient who lay be&shy;fore him&mdash;it
            was ex&shy;plained that that is a symp&shy;tom which is not un&shy;usu&shy;al in cas&shy;es of
            dys&shy;p&shy;nœa and death from car&shy;diac ex&shy;haus&shy;tion.  This ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion was borne
            out by the post-mortem ex&shy;am&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion, which showed long-stand&shy;ing or&shy;gan&shy;ic
            dis&shy;ease, and the coro&shy;ner&rsquo;s jury re&shy;turned a ver&shy;dict in ac&shy;cor&shy;dance
            with the med&shy;ical ev&shy;i&shy;dence.  It is well that this is so, for it is
            ob&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly of the ut&shy;most im&shy;por&shy;tance that Sir Charles&rsquo;s heir should
            set&shy;tle at the Hall and con&shy;tin&shy;ue the good work which has been so sad&shy;ly
            in&shy;ter&shy;rupt&shy;ed.  Had the pro&shy;sa&shy;ic find&shy;ing of the coro&shy;ner not fi&shy;nal&shy;ly put an
            end to the ro&shy;man&shy;tic sto&shy;ries which have been whis&shy;pered in con&shy;nec&shy;tion
            with the af&shy;fair, it might have been dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to find a ten&shy;ant for
            Baskerville Hall.  It is un&shy;der&shy;stood that the next of kin is Mr. Hen&shy;ry
            Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles
            Baskerville&rsquo;s younger broth&shy;er.  The young man when last heard of
            was in Amer&shy;i&shy;ca, and in&shy;quiries are be&shy;ing in&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed with a view to
            in&shy;form&shy;ing him of his good for&shy;tune.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Mor&shy;timer re&shy;fold&shy;ed his pa&shy;per and re&shy;placed it in his pock&shy;et. &ldquo;Those are
          the pub&shy;lic facts, Mr. Holmes, in con&shy;nec&shy;tion with the death of Sir Charles
          Baskerville.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I must thank you,&rdquo; said Sher&shy;lock Holmes, &ldquo;for call&shy;ing my at&shy;ten&shy;tion to a
          case which cer&shy;tain&shy;ly pre&shy;sents some fea&shy;tures of in&shy;ter&shy;est. I had ob&shy;served
          some news&shy;pa&shy;per com&shy;ment at the time, but I was ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly pre&shy;oc&shy;cu&shy;pied by
          that lit&shy;tle af&shy;fair of the Vat&shy;i&shy;can cameos, and in my anx&shy;i&shy;ety to oblige the
          Pope I lost touch with sev&shy;er&shy;al in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing Eng&shy;lish cas&shy;es. This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle,
          you say, con&shy;tains all the pub&shy;lic facts?&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;It does.&rdquo;
         </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Then let me have the pri&shy;vate ones.&rdquo; He leaned back, put his fin&shy;ger-tips
          to&shy;geth&shy;er, and as&shy;sumed his most im&shy;pas&shy;sive and ju&shy;di&shy;cial ex&shy;pres&shy;sion.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;In do&shy;ing so,&rdquo; said Dr. Mor&shy;timer, who had be&shy;gun to show signs of some
          strong emo&shy;tion, &ldquo;I am telling that which I have not con&shy;fid&shy;ed to any&shy;one. My
          mo&shy;tive for with&shy;hold&shy;ing it from the coro&shy;ner&rsquo;s in&shy;quiry is that a man of
          sci&shy;ence shrinks from plac&shy;ing him&shy;self in the pub&shy;lic po&shy;si&shy;tion of seem&shy;ing to
          in&shy;dorse a pop&shy;u&shy;lar su&shy;per&shy;sti&shy;tion. I had the fur&shy;ther mo&shy;tive that Baskerville
          Hall, as the pa&shy;per says, would cer&shy;tain&shy;ly re&shy;main un&shy;tenant&shy;ed if any&shy;thing
          were done to in&shy;crease its al&shy;ready rather grim rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion. For both these
          rea&shy;sons I thought that I was jus&shy;ti&shy;fied in telling rather less than I knew,
          since no prac&shy;ti&shy;cal good could re&shy;sult from it, but with you there is no
          rea&shy;son why I should not be per&shy;fect&shy;ly frank.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The moor is very sparse&shy;ly in&shy;hab&shy;it&shy;ed, and those who live near each oth&shy;er
          are thrown very much to&shy;geth&shy;er. For this rea&shy;son I saw a good deal of Sir
          Charles Baskerville. With the ex&shy;cep&shy;tion of Mr. Fran&shy;k&shy;land, of Lafter Hall,
          and Mr. Sta&shy;ple&shy;ton, the nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ist, there are no oth&shy;er men of ed&shy;u&shy;ca&shy;tion
          with&shy;in many miles. Sir Charles was a re&shy;tir&shy;ing man, but the chance of his
          ill&shy;ness brought us to&shy;geth&shy;er, and a com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty of in&shy;ter&shy;ests in sci&shy;ence kept
          us so. He had brought back much sci&shy;en&shy;tif&shy;ic in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion from South Africa,
          and many a charm&shy;ing evening we have spent to&shy;geth&shy;er dis&shy;cussing the
          com&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tive anato&shy;my of the Bush&shy;man and the Hot&shy;ten&shy;tot.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;With&shy;in the last few months it be&shy;came in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly plain to me that Sir
          Charles&rsquo;s ner&shy;vous sys&shy;tem was strained to the break&shy;ing point. He had tak&shy;en
          this leg&shy;end which I have read you ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly to heart&mdash;so much so
          that, al&shy;though he would walk in his own grounds, noth&shy;ing would in&shy;duce him
          to go out upon the moor at night. In&shy;cred&shy;i&shy;ble as it may ap&shy;pear to you, Mr.
          Holmes, he was hon&shy;est&shy;ly con&shy;vinced that a dread&shy;ful fate over&shy;hung his
          fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and cer&shy;tain&shy;ly the records which he was able to give of his
          an&shy;ces&shy;tors were not en&shy;cour&shy;ag&shy;ing. The idea of some ghast&shy;ly pres&shy;ence
          con&shy;stant&shy;ly haunt&shy;ed him, and on more than one oc&shy;ca&shy;sion he has asked me
          whether I had on my med&shy;ical jour&shy;neys at night ever seen any strange
          crea&shy;ture or heard the bay&shy;ing of a hound. The lat&shy;ter ques&shy;tion he put to me
          sev&shy;er&shy;al times, and al&shy;ways with a voice which vi&shy;brat&shy;ed with ex&shy;cite&shy;ment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I can well re&shy;mem&shy;ber dri&shy;ving up to his house in the evening some three
          weeks be&shy;fore the fa&shy;tal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had
          de&shy;scend&shy;ed from my gig and was stand&shy;ing in front of him, when I saw his
          eyes fix them&shy;selves over my shoul&shy;der and stare past me with an ex&shy;pres&shy;sion
          of the most dread&shy;ful hor&shy;ror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a
          glimpse of some&shy;thing which I took to be a large black calf pass&shy;ing at the
          head of the dri&shy;ve. So ex&shy;cit&shy;ed and alarmed was he that I was com&shy;pelled to
          go down to the spot where the an&shy;i&shy;mal had been and look around for it. It
          was gone, how&shy;ev&shy;er, and the in&shy;ci&shy;dent ap&shy;peared to make the worst im&shy;pres&shy;sion
          upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that
          oc&shy;ca&shy;sion, to ex&shy;plain the emo&shy;tion which he had shown, that he con&shy;fid&shy;ed to
          my keep&shy;ing that nar&shy;ra&shy;tive which I read to you when first I came. I men&shy;tion
          this small episode be&shy;cause it as&shy;sumes some im&shy;por&shy;tance in view of the
          tragedy which fol&shy;lowed, but I was con&shy;vinced at the time that the mat&shy;ter
          was en&shy;tire&shy;ly triv&shy;ial and that his ex&shy;cite&shy;ment had no jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;It was at my ad&shy;vice that Sir Charles was about to go to Lon&shy;don. His heart
          was, I knew, af&shy;fect&shy;ed, and the con&shy;stant anx&shy;i&shy;ety in which he lived, how&shy;ev&shy;er
          chimeri&shy;cal the cause of it might be, was ev&shy;i&shy;dent&shy;ly hav&shy;ing a se&shy;ri&shy;ous ef&shy;fect
          upon his health. I thought that a few months among the dis&shy;trac&shy;tions of
          town would send him back a new man. Mr. Sta&shy;ple&shy;ton, a mu&shy;tu&shy;al friend who was
          much con&shy;cerned at his state of health, was of the same opin&shy;ion. At the
          last in&shy;stant came this ter&shy;ri&shy;ble cat&shy;a&shy;stro&shy;phe.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;On the night of Sir Charles&rsquo;s death Bar&shy;ry&shy;more the but&shy;ler, who made the
          dis&shy;cov&shy;ery, sent Perkins the groom on horse&shy;back to me, and as I was sit&shy;ting
          up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall with&shy;in an hour of the event.
          I checked and cor&shy;rob&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed all the facts which were men&shy;tioned at the
          in&shy;quest. I fol&shy;lowed the foot&shy;steps down the yew al&shy;ley, I saw the spot at
          the moor-gate where he seemed to have wait&shy;ed, I re&shy;marked the change in the
          shape of the prints af&shy;ter that point, I not&shy;ed that there were no oth&shy;er
          foot&shy;steps save those of Bar&shy;ry&shy;more on the soft grav&shy;el, and fi&shy;nal&shy;ly I
          care&shy;ful&shy;ly ex&shy;am&shy;ined the body, which had not been touched un&shy;til my ar&shy;rival.
          Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fin&shy;gers dug into the
          ground, and his fea&shy;tures con&shy;vulsed with some strong emo&shy;tion to such an
          ex&shy;tent that I could hard&shy;ly have sworn to his iden&shy;ti&shy;ty. There was cer&shy;tain&shy;ly
          no phys&shy;i&shy;cal in&shy;jury of any kind. But one false state&shy;ment was made by
          Bar&shy;ry&shy;more at the in&shy;quest. He said that there were no traces upon the
          ground round the body. He did not ob&shy;serve any. But I did&mdash;some lit&shy;tle
          dis&shy;tance off, but fresh and clear.&rdquo;

          Dr. Mor&shy;timer looked strange&shy;ly at us for an in&shy;stant, and his voice sank
          al&shy;most to a whis&shy;per as he an&shy;swered.

          &ldquo;Mr. Holmes, they were the foot&shy;prints of a gi&shy;gan&shy;tic hound!&rdquo;
