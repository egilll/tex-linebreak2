          &ldquo;The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
          has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at
          the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.  Though Sir
          Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short
          period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the
          affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
          him.  In these days of <i>nouveaux riches</i> it is refreshing to find a case
          where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days
          is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to
          restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well
          known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise
          than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realised
          his gains and returned to England with them.  It is only two years
          since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common
          talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
          which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it
          was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,
          within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have
          personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous
          donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled
          in these columns.<br />
              &ldquo;The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
          cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at
          least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local
          superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect
          foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural
          causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have
          been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his
          considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his
          indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named
          Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
          Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show
          that Sir Charles&rsquo;s health has for some time been impaired, and
          points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
          changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous
          depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the
          deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.<br />
              &ldquo;The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
          was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the
          famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence of the Barrymores
          shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles
          had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had
          ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as
          usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the
          habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At twelve o&rsquo;clock
          Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and,
          lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.  The day had been
          wet, and Sir Charles&rsquo;s footmarks were easily traced down the
          alley.  Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to
          the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some
          little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the
          far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been
          explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master&rsquo;s
          footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the
          moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking
          upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no
          great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to
          have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is
          unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of violence
          were to be discovered upon Sir Charles&rsquo;s person, and though the
          doctor&rsquo;s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial
          distortion&mdash;so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe
          that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him&mdash;it
          was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
          dyspn≈ìa and death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne
          out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
          disease, and the coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict in accordance
          with the medical evidence.  It is well that this is so, for it is
          obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles&rsquo;s heir should
          settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
          interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an
          end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection
          with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for
          Baskerville Hall.  It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry
          Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles
          Baskerville&rsquo;s younger brother.  The young man when last heard of
          was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to
          informing him of his good fortune.&rdquo;

<h1>THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES</h1>
<h4>Another Adventure of Sherlock Holmes</h4>
<h2>by A. Conan Doyle</h2>
<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap01"></a>Chapter 1.<br />
Mr. Sherlock Holmes</h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon
      those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the
      breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which
      our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
      piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a &ldquo;Penang
      lawyer.&rdquo; Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
      across. &ldquo;To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,&rdquo; was
      engraved upon it, with the date &ldquo;1884.&rdquo; It was just such a stick as the
      old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry&mdash;dignified, solid,
      and reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Watson, what do you make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of
      your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
      me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor&rsquo;s
      stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion
      of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear
      you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
      companion, &ldquo;that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
      well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
      appreciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
      practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
      knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
      The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
      great amount of walking with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sound!&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then again, there is the &lsquo;friends of the C.C.H.&rsquo; I should guess that
      to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly
      given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
      presentation in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Watson, you excel yourself,&rdquo; said Holmes, pushing back his chair
      and lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;I am bound to say that in all the accounts
      which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you
      have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not
      yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without
      possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my
      dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me
      keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my
      admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his
      methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system
      as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick
      from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then
      with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying
      the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting, though elementary,&rdquo; said he as he returned to his favourite
      corner of the settee. &ldquo;There are certainly one or two indications upon the
      stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything escaped me?&rdquo; I asked with some self-importance. &ldquo;I trust
      that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
      in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not
      that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
      country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear Watson, not all&mdash;by no means all. I would suggest,
      for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a
      hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials &lsquo;C.C.&rsquo; are placed
      before that hospital the words &lsquo;Charing Cross&rsquo; very naturally suggest
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working
      hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of
      this unknown visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, supposing that &lsquo;C.C.H.&rsquo; does stand for &lsquo;Charing Cross
      Hospital,&rsquo; what further inferences may we draw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in
      town before going to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in
      this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a
      presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a
      pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer
      withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for
      himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been
      a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,
      stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
      occasion of the change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly seems probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the <i>staff</i> of the
      hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
      hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
      What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he
      could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician&mdash;little
      more than a senior student. And he left five years ago&mdash;the date is
      on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
      thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
      amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog,
      which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller
      than a mastiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and
      blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but at
      least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man&rsquo;s
      age and professional career.&rdquo; From my small medical shelf I took down the
      Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers,
      but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of
        the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled
        &lsquo;Is Disease a Reversion?&rsquo;  Corresponding member of the
        Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of &lsquo;Some Freaks of
        Atavism&rsquo; (<i>Lancet</i> 1882).  &lsquo;Do We Progress?&rsquo;
        (<i>Journal of Psychology</i>, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the
        parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mention of that local hunt, Watson,&rdquo; said Holmes with a mischievous
      smile, &ldquo;but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that
      I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I
      remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my
      experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives
      testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the
      country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
      heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
      his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog&rsquo;s jaw, as shown in the space
      between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
      broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been&mdash;yes, by Jove, it <i>is</i> a
      curly-haired spaniel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess
      of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I
      glanced up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very
      door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don&rsquo;t move, I beg you,
      Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of
      assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you
      hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know
      not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of
      science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a
      typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long
      nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, grey eyes, set
      closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed
      glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for
      his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long
      back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon
      the stick in Holmes&rsquo;s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of
      joy. &ldquo;I am so very glad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was not sure whether I had left it
      here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A presentation, I see,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Charing Cross Hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, that&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; said Holmes, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. &ldquo;Why was it
      bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a
      consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;And now,
      Dr. James Mortimer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister, sir, Mister&mdash;a humble M.R.C.S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a man of precise mind, evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of
      the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I
      am addressing and not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection
      with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had
      hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
      supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
      finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the
      original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum.
      It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your
      skull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. &ldquo;You are an
      enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
      cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
      with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
      restless as the antenn√¶ of an insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
      which he took in our curious companion. &ldquo;I presume, sir,&rdquo; said he at last,
      &ldquo;that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you
      have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that
      as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself
      an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most
      serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the
      second highest expert in Europe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?&rdquo; asked
      Holmes with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
      must always appeal strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then had you not better consult him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of
      affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have
      not inadvertently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely
      if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature
      of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I have in my pocket a manuscript,&rdquo; said Dr. James Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I observed it as you entered the room,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an old manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
      that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
      the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
      my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The exact date is 1742.&rdquo; Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
      &ldquo;This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
      whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
      excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well
      as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
      practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document
      very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
      eventually overtake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
      his knee. &ldquo;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the
      long <i>s</i> and the short. It is one of several indications which
      enabled me to fix the date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At
      the head was written: &ldquo;Baskerville Hall,&rdquo; and below in large, scrawling
      figures: &ldquo;1742.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
      which you wish to consult me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
      within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
      connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
      closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
      manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
      curious, old-world narrative:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville,
        and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have
        set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth.
         And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which
        punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so
        heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then
        from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be
        circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family
        has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.<br />
            &ldquo;Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend
        to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that
        name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and
        godless man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was
        in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word
        through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed,
        so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of
        a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young
        maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for
        she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this
        Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down
        upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being
        from home, as he well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the
        maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat
        down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor
        lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and
        shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they
        say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were
        such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the stress of
        her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most
        active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and
        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so
        homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall
        and her father&rsquo;s farm.<br />
            &ldquo;It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests
        to carry food and drink&mdash;with other worse things,
        perchance&mdash;to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the
        bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a
        devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang
        upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he
        cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render
        his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
        wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man,
        one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out
        that they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the
        house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and
        unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the
        maid&rsquo;s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the
        moonlight over the moor.<br />
            &ldquo;Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to
        understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon their
        bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done
        upon the moorlands.  Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for
        their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of
        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and
        the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in
        pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly
        abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she
        were to reach her own home.<br />
            &ldquo;They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he
        had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with
        fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed
        seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  &lsquo;But I
        have seen more than that,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for Hugo Baskerville
        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a
        hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.&rsquo;  So the
        drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.  But soon their
        skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the
        black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle
        and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a great
        fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each,
        had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his
        horse&rsquo;s head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last
        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour and their breed,
        were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we
        call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting
        hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before
        them.<br />
            &ldquo;The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
        guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by no means
        advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken,
        rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which
        stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set
        by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining
        bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid
        where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the
        sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville
        lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
        dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and
        plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,
        shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has
        rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of
        Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping
        jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life,
        still screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that very
        night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for
        the rest of their days.<br />
            &ldquo;Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which
        is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since.  If I have set
        it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than
        that which is but hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that
        many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been
        sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter ourselves in the
        infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the
        innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in
        Holy Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I
        counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in
        those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.<br />
            &ldquo;[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,
        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister
        Elizabeth.]&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
      his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not find it interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a collector of fairy tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is
      the <i>Devon County Chronicle</i> of May 14th of this year. It is a short account
      of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which
      occurred a few days before that date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our
      visitor readjusted his glasses and began:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
        &ldquo;The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at
        the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.  Though Sir
        Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short
        period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the
        affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
        him.  In these days of <i>nouveaux riches</i> it is refreshing to find a case
        where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days
        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to
        restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well
        known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise
        than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realised
        his gains and returned to England with them.  It is only two years
        since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common
        talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it
        was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,
        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have
        personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous
        donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled
        in these columns.<br />
            &ldquo;The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at
        least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local
        superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect
        foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural
        causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have
        been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his
        considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his
        indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named
        Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show
        that Sir Charles&rsquo;s health has for some time been impaired, and
        points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
        changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous
        depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the
        deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.<br />
            &ldquo;The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the
        famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence of the Barrymores
        shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles
        had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had
        ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as
        usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the
        habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At twelve o&rsquo;clock
        Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and,
        lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.  The day had been
        wet, and Sir Charles&rsquo;s footmarks were easily traced down the
        alley.  Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to
        the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some
        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the
        far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been
        explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master&rsquo;s
        footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the
        moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking
        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no
        great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to
        have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is
        unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of violence
        were to be discovered upon Sir Charles&rsquo;s person, and though the
        doctor&rsquo;s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial
        distortion&mdash;so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe
        that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him&mdash;it
        was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
        dyspn≈ìa and death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne
        out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
        disease, and the coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict in accordance
        with the medical evidence.  It is well that this is so, for it is
        obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles&rsquo;s heir should
        settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an
        end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection
        with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for
        Baskerville Hall.  It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry
        Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles
        Baskerville&rsquo;s younger brother.  The young man when last heard of
        was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to
        informing him of his good fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. &ldquo;Those are
      the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles
      Baskerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, &ldquo;for calling my attention to a
      case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed
      some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by
      that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the
      Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article,
      you say, contains all the public facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me have the private ones.&rdquo; He leaned back, put his finger-tips
      together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In doing so,&rdquo; said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
      strong emotion, &ldquo;I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My
      motive for withholding it from the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry is that a man of
      science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to
      indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville
      Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything
      were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew,
      since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no
      reason why I should not be perfectly frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
      are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir
      Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall,
      and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education
      within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his
      illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept
      us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa,
      and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the
      comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken
      this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart&mdash;so much so
      that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him
      to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr.
      Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his
      family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his
      ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me
      whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange
      creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me
      several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three
      weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had
      descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his
      eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression
      of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a
      glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the
      head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to
      go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It
      was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression
      upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that
      occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to
      my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention
      this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the
      tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter
      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart
      was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however
      chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect
      upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of
      town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was
      much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the
      last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the night of Sir Charles&rsquo;s death Barrymore the butler, who made the
      discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting
      up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event.
      I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the
      inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at
      the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other
      footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I
      carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival.
      Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the
      ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an
      extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly
      no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by
      Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the
      ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did&mdash;some little
      distance off, but fresh and clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footprints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footprints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank
      almost to a whisper as he answered.
